# green-social-network-api

## Description
This project is to create social network api using mongoDB and mongoose. Using insomnia I will test each GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. I will show how to GET all users plus users by id, create user, update user, and delete user. Create a friend and delete a friend. GET all thoughts plus thoughts by id, create thought, update thought, and delete thought. Create a reaction to a thought and delete a reaction.
